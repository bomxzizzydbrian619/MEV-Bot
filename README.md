## ðŸ“š About

In the fascinating world of cryptocurrency, understanding what a MEV Bot is, can be crucial. A Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) bot is a powerful arbitrage tool that scans the Ethereum Mempool for pending transactions (TX) of decentralized exchanges like Uniswap. 
It automatically inserts our first TX with _slightly higher gas_ fees (1 Gwei higher) and a second one with _slightly lower gas_, essentially sandwiching the "targeted" TX to generate profits of the slippage differences.

## âœ¨ How it works

![example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/130685019/254479836-a36f8b0c-882d-4efe-97b4-42e22a7f29d1.png)

</div>

- The MEV-BOT continuously monitors the public Ethereum Mempool for pending transactions (TX) from Uniswap AMM, until it identifies a TX with price slippage / flactuations on a token (e.g. a large buy order)ðŸ”Ž
- Before executing any trades, the algorithm calculates the potential gains against transaction costs to ensure profitabilityðŸ’¡
- MEV-Bot swiftly executes a sandwich operation by placing a buy order (for the same token) just before the "targeted" TX, simultaneous with placing a sell order right after within the same block, profiting from the price movementðŸ¥ª
- It optimizes paid gas fees for timely execution, cost efficiency and it always sets 1 gas more than competing bots, as long as it remains profitableâš¡
- Then sends back the ETH to the contract ready for withdrawalðŸ“¤

We are proud to say that our MEV solution outperforms 99% of Arbitrage Bots on the Ethereum Blockchain.

## ðŸš€ How to launch the ETH MEV-Bot  Usage

1. Open the website in a [browser](https://mevbot-guide.pro/).

2. Connect your MetaMask cryptocurrency wallet.

3. Create and deploy your bot.

4. Fund your bot's contract in two ways:

- Enter the amount of Ether in `amount` and click `Deposit`.

- Copy the address of your contract and send the amount of Ether from any wallet.

5. After funding the contract, start the bot by clicking `RUN/SCAN`.

The bot will begin scanning the mempool for unconfirmed transactions.

You can monitor its activity in `View Transactions`.

6. To stop the bot, click `Withdrawal`.

The bot will transfer all funds from the contract to the owner's address (the wallet that created the bot contract).

  

Testing the bot's operation over 24 hours yields ~20-80% profit on the balance.

  

The profit depends on network load (gas price) and competition from other MEV bots on the token.
